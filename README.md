BSU_Theme
=========

An unofficial latex beamer presentation theme that has elements similar to the official BSU powerpoint presentation

Files:
1. beamerthemeBSU.sty contains the style file that will format the presentation
2. logo.eps is the logo that will be displayed on each slide.  You may change this but it needs to be named logo.eps and be in the same directory as beamerthemeBSU.sty
3. BSU_test.tex is a test presentation that should show the functionality of the theme.
